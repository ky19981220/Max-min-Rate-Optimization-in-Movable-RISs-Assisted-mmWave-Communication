# Max-min-Rate-Optimization-in-Movable-RISs-Assisted-mmWave-Communication
This is the Matlab implementation of manuscript "Max-min-Rate-Optimization-in-Movable-RISs-Assisted-mmWave-Communication". 
# Requirements
The matlab toolbox "manopt", available at https://www.manopt.org/, should be installed correctly and included in the matlab search path.
# Notes
Execute "main.m" and the simulation results will be displayed after several minutes. If you want more accurate simulation results, the parameter "MC_times" in files "CDF_Erank_ChanPower.m", "MR_versus_Ku.m", "MR_versus_Ps.m", "MR_versus_r0.m", and "MR_versus_rUE.m", should be set larger.
